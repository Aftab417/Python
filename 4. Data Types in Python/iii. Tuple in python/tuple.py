# Tuple : Tuple is a collecrion of items which are ordered and unchangeable. 

# tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
# print(tuple)




# tuple store any type of data. 
# tuple = ("banana", True, False, 343, "hello")
# print(tuple)





# WE can access items in tuple.

# tuple = ("aftab", "banana", 34, True, "hello")
# print(tuple[3])
# print(tuple[0])





# We can apply slicing mathod to tuple. It is similiar as in string and list.

# tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
# print(tuple[2:3])
# print(tuple[:4])
# print(tuple[2:])
# print(tuple[-5:-2])





# We can check either a value is present in tuple or not.

# tuple = (1, 3, 5, 6)

# if 1 in tuple:
#     print("yes 1 is present in tuple.")





# We can concatenate two tuple using + operator.

# tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
# tuple2 = ("a", "b", "c", "d")
# print(tuple1 + tuple2)



#########################------------ tuple count method -------------#######################

# count method : we can count how many times an element is repeated in tuple.

# tuple = (1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, )
# print(tuple.count(2))
# print(tuple.count(3))




#########################------------ tuple index method -------------#######################

# index method : This method is used to check on which index the specified value exist in tuple.

# tuple = (1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6,)
# print(tuple.index(4))
# print(tuple.index(3))
