# Indexing in string :  In a string, each character is assigned a value starting from 0. This is called indexing. We can access any character in the string by using its index value.


# name = "Aftab"
# print(name[0])
# print(name[3])
# print(name[4])




# We can check the length of string by using len() function.
# y = "I am a boy. I like to play Football."
# print(len(y))




# we can check either a letter or word is present or not present in the string by using membership operators.
# z = " My name is Aftab Ahmad. I am 18 years old. I like to play Football."
# if "Aftab" in z:
#     print("Yes, Aftab is present in z.")

# if "Ali" not in z:
#     print("No, Ali is not in z")
