# Slicing in String : Accesing a specific part of string is called slicing in string. For this we define statring and ending indexes that we want to access.

name = "Aftab Ahmad"
# print(len(name))       # Length of string is 11.  Note: in slicing ending index is not included.
# print(name[0:11])      # Aftab Ahmad
# print(name[:11])       # Aftab Ahmad
# print(name[0:])        # Aftab Ahmad
# print(name[:])         # Aftab Ahmad
# print(name[2:9])       # tab Ahm
# print(name[-3:-1])       # ma
# print(name[-11:-1])      # Aftab Ahma
