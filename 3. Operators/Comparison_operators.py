# comparison operators compare between two values

# x = 3          # values 3 is assgn to x, means x has value '3'
# x == 3         # x is equal to 3
# x != 2         # x is not equal to 2
# x > 2          # x is greater than 2
# x < 5          # x is less than 5
# x >= 3         # x is greater than or equal to 3
# x <= 5         # x is less than or equal to 5
