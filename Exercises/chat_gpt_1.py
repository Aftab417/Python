# Write a Python program to store your name, age, and city in separate variables and print them.

# name = "Aftab"
# age = 17
# city = "Layyah"
# print(name, age, city)


# Create a program to calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers stored in variables.

# a = 8
# b = 2

# print(a + b, a - b, a * b, a ** b, a / b, a % b,)



# Write a program to swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.

# a = int(input("Enter value of a : "))
# b = int(input("Enter value of b : "))

# a = a + b
# b = a - b
# a = a - b

# print("After swaping")
# print("value of a is ", a)
# print("value of b is ", b)





# Store the length and width of a rectangle in two variables and calculate its area and perimeter.

# length = int(input("Enter the lenght : "))
# width = int(input("Enter the width : "))
# area = length * width
# perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
# print("Area of rectangle is ", area)
# print("parimeter of rectangle is ", perimeter)






# Write a program to store the price of an item and the sales tax percentage in variables. Calculate and print the total price after tax.

# price = float(input("Enter the price of item: "))
# tax_per = float(input("Enter the tax percentage: "))

# tax_amout = (tax_per / 100) * price
# total_price = price + tax_amout

# print(f"Total price of item after tax is: ${total_price}")






# Assign values to three variables and calculate their average.

# a = float(input("Enter first value: "))
# b = float(input("Enter second value: "))
# c = float(input("Enter third value: "))

# average = (a + b + c) / 3
# print("Average of three values is : ", average)





# Write a program to store the radius of a circle in a variable and calculate its area (πr²) and circumference (2πr). Use 3.14 for π.

# r = float(input("Enter the radius of circle: "))
# area = 3.14 * (r **2)
# circum = 2 * (3.14 * r)

# print("Area of circle is :", area)
# print("Circumference of circle is :", circum)





# Create a program to store your first and last name in two variables and print your full name by concatenating them.

# first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
# last_name = input("Enter your last name: ")
# full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
# print("Your FullName is : ", full_name)
